Changelog:
2024-05-21 
SHCS for the rail mounting didn't fit; I hadn't realized this earlier because it's a factor that changed from when I was using tiger3dprintings cad as a base for my changes.
Belt clips need an increase in tolerance for the excess belt section.
Change the back screws to all be bottom mounted, So the duct can be installed after going onto the linear rail. As a result, Aluminum foil tape has been added to the BOM + will be used to cover the screw holes.
Beacon Sherlock gave more clearance + better strain relief (SLM Duct Changes)
Rail mounting screws were changed to M3x8mm SHCS

BOM Changes
4x M3x8mm SHCS (added)
4x M3X10mm SHCS (removed)
Aluminum Foil for ducts (added)

Have an older version of takeoff. What parts are reusable?
The Mainbody + Duct are the only parts that are not reusable with the current changes. I initially decided that for better airflow characteristics, the maintenance far outweighs the cons when you use aluminum foil to cover those sections.
